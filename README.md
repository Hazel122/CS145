# Data Structure Projects - Green River College CS 145

Welcome to my repository of Data Structure projects developed during my coursework in CS 145 at Green River College. These projects showcase my skills in advanced Java programming concepts, including inheritance, abstract classes, Java collections, and object-oriented principles such as overloading, overriding, and recursion.

## Projects

### EvilHangman
**Overview:** A tricky version of hangman where the computer delays picking a word to maximize difficulty for the player. The game involves dynamic word pattern updating based on player's guesses.
- **Skills:** Utilization of Java Collections classes (map, set).

### GuitarHero
**Overview:** A simulation of guitar strings' vibration and sound production, playable via the keyboard. This project mimics the physical properties of string vibration and sound generation.
- **Skills:** Implementation of queues, interfaces, and objects in a musical context.

### QuestionTree
**Overview:** An interactive "20 Questions" game. The computer attempts to guess objects thought of by the player using a binary tree to store and navigate through questions and answers.
- **Skills:** Deep dive into binary trees and recursion.

### ShoppingCart
**Overview:** A simulation of a shopping cart, allowing users to add and remove items. This project demonstrates handling of user input and output, along with robust input validation.
- **Skills:** Focus on user interaction and dynamic data handling.
