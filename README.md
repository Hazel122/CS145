# Data Structure projects

This repository contains a collection of individual data structure projects developed as part of my coursework in Green River College CS 145. These projects demonstrate the application of advanced inheritance concepts in Java, use of abstract classes, implementation of Java collections, and exploration of object-oriented programming principles like overloading, overriding, and recursion.
